      <h2>Are you planning an outdoor event?</h2>
      <p>The tents and tables are up, catering is set, all the details have been checked off the list. You have the
        perfect event planned…and then the storm hits. You realize that there’s really only one thing you can’t control:
        the weather. </p>
      <p>Many times, event planners don’t think about weather when planning their outdoor event. They hope it doesn’t
        rain and may even consider a backup plan. But what about severe weather, strong winds or lightning? It is
        important to be proactive and think ahead about the impact of severe weather on your event rather than leaving
        it to chance. Incorporating a severe-weather plan can ensure you are better prepared and can help avoid chaos if
        a storm hits. There are necessary steps you can take to ensure that if the weather does turn bad, you’ve got a
        protocol and plan in place to keep attendees and staff safe.</p>
